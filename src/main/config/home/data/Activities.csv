Platen s innovative benchmark approach addresses a fundamental empirical inconsistency of modern finance,  leading to serious overpricing. This new paradigm will be extended to insurance and other areas of risk management, demonstrating that many insurance and superannuation products can be created for less than half the currently marketed price. The proposed breakthrough in simulation technology will reduce the time for computing such complex contracts and the measurement of risk for large nonlinear portfolios from several hours down to seconds.","University of Technology, Sydney","Prof Eckhard Platen; TBA Research-Student","parallel Monte Carlo simulation; valuation and risk measurement; superannuation; insurance; benchmark approach; variance reduction;"

These policies have had limited effect however on clinician's inclination to disclose incidents. There are a number of barriers to disclosure including fears of legal prosecution and organisational complexity that this research will examine. The project aims to bridge the existing communication divide between clinicians who feel constrained in what they say and who default to limited or no-disclosure, and patient-consumers who expect and deserve openness and restorative action from the service when an incident results in harm. This project will map disclosure communication in its aim to enhance clinician-patient and clinician-clinician dialogue about health care incidents.
